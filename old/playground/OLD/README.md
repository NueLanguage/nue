# üï∏Ô∏è OLD Playground

Welcome to nue's old playground. This was some playground code written during the very initial brainstorming of nue and it's syntax, etc.

This code was written before breaking changes were introduced, which includes:

- New way of declaring functions and their return types
- Not sure about all of the changes, but a few breaking ones.

Code from this OLD playground directory will likely not work at all today, and is only kept for archival purposes to see how nue has evolved during brainstorming and initial ideas.

Fun fact: I initially thought I should name the programming language "nu", but after a quick search, it turned out that something like that already existed and also the GitHub organisation username was already taken üò¨. Although the other "nu" programming language that I saw is completely trash, I decided to be respectful and not steal their name. Also, nue sounds way cooler and barely conflicts with any existing things.

# ðŸŽ‰ nue Playground
Welcome to the nue playground, where brainstorm code is written to play around with nue.

As of 8th August 2024, I have completely stopped saving nue code files using the `.swift` file extension in order to avoid confusion. This project and this repository have no affiliation with swift whatsoever, and swift is not used anywhere. This entire scripting language is written in C.
I have, however, added a Visual Studio Code configuration to apply swift syntax highlighting to `.nu` files just so that opened filed look nice (temporarily, because swift and nue dont have the same syntax and this is used only temporarily purely for aesthetic purposes) instead of looking like an unrecognised plain text file.

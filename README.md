The Nue Programming Language

**Nue** is an experimental programming language designed with simplicity and versatility in mind. The goal is to create a modern yet lightweight language that supports a wide range of use cases and doesn't compromise any advanced functionality in favour of simple language design.

<!-- [What does nue look like? (coming soon)](./LEARN.md) -->

## üö¶ Project Status

Nue is currently in development, with a primary focus on building the core components such as the tokeniser and parser to a functional state.

Functionality is currently being prioritised over organisation, which means:

- There is likely to be licence incompatibility during the development phase due to the potential (future) use of various libraries and components

Once Nue is "finished" (i.e. in a basic working state), the repository will be re-organised, and all dependencies will be reviewed for licensing compatibility.

## Testing the Tokeniser/Lexer

Currently, the main entry point of the entire project is the original tokeniser itself, with some extra features.

### As a standalone REPL
```shell
nue
```

Running `nue` opens a REPL which allows you to test the functionality of the current tokeniser. If you run it without any arguments, it will prompt you whether you would like to open REPL mode.

> [!NOTE]
>
> ```shell
> nue --silent
> ```
>
> Running the `nue` repl with the `--silent` argument removes token usage statistics being printed upon every new line in REPL mode

### Testing with a nue file
This will print all the tokens used in a provided nue file:
```shell
nue file.nue
```

This project is in early development and is subject to significant changes. Use or reference the code at your own risk, as it may contain incomplete features, broken C code and licensing conflicts. (don't want to anger the Stallman wannabes, do I?)

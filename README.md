The nue Programming Language

## ✏️ Contributing

I have decided to make variable names and comments INCREDIBLY clear so that this project can easily receive support and get people looking at it without having to uselessly spend countless hours trying to figure out what everything is.

Having friendly names and comments aligns with the ethos of the nue project. I aim to make the code understandable for absolutely everyone. Thats how friendly and understandable the comments should be.

Here's a challenge when contributing: Your comments should be so descriptive that a 10 year old child should be able to understand C.. 😂🤣 (said no one ever!)
